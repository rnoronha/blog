This is the first post on my blog, to see how Github static page hosting works!

# Let's do some markdown: 
## And a sub-title
### And a sub-sub title
#### how far down do the titles go
##### help I'm trapped in a title
###### oh my god there's no end

`this.is(code)`

```
this is longer code
maybe it's some sort of shell script
I don't know it isn't specified
```

```javascript
// This code is definitely javascript though
// But which version? It is a mystery. 

const foo = function(a) {
	console.log("you gave me " + a);
};

let bar = (a) => {
	console.log("I prefer '" + a + "' arrow thnx");
};

function baz(a) {
	what about completely invalid syntax?
	(That's what Knuth meant by literate programming right?
}
```

    This is also code, but it uses four indents
	They're spaces obviously

This has a bit of *emphasis*

This is a **bold statement**

Here's a ^superscript who knows if I'll use that  
Oh I guess I won't because it doesn't work

1. This is an ordered list
2. It only has two entries
3. Whoops here's a third

* These are bullet points
* They are very business
* wow so succinct 
    * nested too
	* we're really detail oriented here on this blog
	1. and here's a number outta nowhere
	3. they continue on too
2. It's always really bothered me that markdown just ignores the number you actually put in for ordered lists
7. I mean that's a seven back there
9. Wikipedia formatting is better since it doesn't even pretend you can control the numbers
10. Though I guess this version is OK because you can start at whatever number you want
